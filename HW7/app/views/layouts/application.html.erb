				Follow the blog post on the NYCDA <a href ="http://nycda.com/blog/basic-user-authentication-model-in-rails-4/" _target="blank">blog</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Make sure that youâ€™re completely familiar with how password salting and password hashing works. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Use class methods in a Rails app to DRY up your code
			</li>
			<li>
				Attempt what we did in class (implementing a User model) from scratch once again. If you finish, associate another model to the User model, such as a posts model, and implement functionality for the user to create posts.
			</li>
			<li>
				This lesson was inspired by the following Railscast, which you may also find helpful, although it is a bit out of date: http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch
